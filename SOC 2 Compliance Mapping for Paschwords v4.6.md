# SOC 2 Compliance Mapping for Paschwords v4.6

## Overview
**Tool Name**: Paschwords  
**Version**: 4.6  
**Primary Use**: Secure, role-based password management with tamper-evident logging and encrypted storage  
**Deployment Responsibility**: Designed by developer for compliant usage; secure deployment and monitoring are the responsibility of the host organization

## üß± SECURITY PRINCIPLE (CC6.x ‚Äì Logical and Physical Access Controls)

| SOC 2 Control | Description | Paschwords Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| CC6.1 | Logical access controls to protect against unauthorized access | RBAC with 3 privilege levels; 2FA enforcement; user auth with PBKDF2+salt+SHA256 |
| CC6.2 | Identification and authentication mechanisms | Master and user passwords handled separately; secure authentication without password storage |
| CC6.3 | Prevent brute-force attacks | Brute-force protection for both master key and users; failed attempts tracked |
| CC6.4 | Role-based access to restrict operations | RBAC allows fine-grained control over administrative and user-level operations |
| CC6.6 | Timely removal of access | Built-in user management; immediate removal from encrypted user registry |

## üõ°Ô∏è CONFIDENTIALITY PRINCIPLE (CC7.x ‚Äì System Operations)

| SOC 2 Control | Description | Paschwords Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| CC7.1 | Detection of configuration changes or security events | All auth and system events are timestamped and logged with chained HMAC integrity |
| CC7.2 | Monitoring of system activity | Full log coverage of user actions, logins, privilege changes, and session markers |
| CC7.3 | Protection of confidential data | All sensitive data encrypted with AES-256-CBC + HMAC, using unique IVs |
| CC7.4 | Transmission and storage protection | File-level encryption + Base64-encoded entries; secure compression before encryption |

---

## üîç PROCESS INTEGRITY PRINCIPLE (CC8.x ‚Äì Change Management)

| SOC 2 Control | Description | Paschwords Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| CC8.1 | Unauthorized changes are prevented | Module encrypted and executed in memory (v4.5); cannot be altered without full rebuild |
| CC8.2 | Logging of configuration or role changes | Admin changes, including user registry changes, are logged with timestamps and HMAC chaining |

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è AVAILABILITY PRINCIPLE (CC9.x ‚Äì System Monitoring)

| SOC 2 Control | Description | Paschwords Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| CC9.2 | Backup and recovery procedures | External to tool; user registry and database files can be backed up securely in encrypted form |
| CC9.3 | Accurate time sources | NTP sync supported for trusted session timing and hashing coordination |

---

## üìú AUDIT & MONITORING PRINCIPLE (CC10.x ‚Äì Monitoring Activities)

| SOC 2 Control | Description | Paschwords Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| CC10.1 | Logging of user activity and security events | Full session logging with timestamps, privilege info, auth results |
| CC10.2 | Tamper-evident logs | Logs validated with chained HMACs; verification tool detects tampering or gaps |
| CC10.3 | Alerting on anomalies | Brute-force detection, privilege abuse, and invalid log blocks can be flagged manually or via integrations |

## üßæ Deployment Notes

While **Paschwords** meets technical criteria for SOC 2 compliance, actual certification depends on:
- **Secure deployment environments** (e.g., restricted file system access, patched OS)
- **Controlled backup, recovery, and monitoring processes**
- **Internal policies and evidence generation for auditors**
